    You've made your selections, now if you want to play for BIG MONEY ($5), send the BIG MONEY ($5) to Frank or
    bring it with you to the party. I prefer - if you can - that you send the five bucks via the internets, it'll make life
    easier on me at the party itself (because I won't have to manipulate databases after 5 old fashioneds).

    Frank accepts Paypal at fkearney8+paypal@gmail.com and Amazon payments at fkearney8+amazon@gmail.com

    Play for money, it'll be more fun! We'll have a leaderboard at the party so you can see how you fare against everyone else.
