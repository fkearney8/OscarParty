    You've made your selections, now if you want to play for BIG MONEY ($10), send the BIG MONEY ($10) to Frank or
    bring it with you to the party. I prefer - if you can - that you send the money via the internets, it'll make life
    easier on me at the party.

    Play for money, it'll be more fun! We'll have a leaderboard at the party so you can see how you fare against everyone else.
